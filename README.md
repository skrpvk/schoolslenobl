#Master Thesis. The work proposes a methodological framework for evaluating the internal and external environments of schools in urban settings, based on  the principles of Child Friendly Cities. A multi-criteria evaluation model is formulated, integrating spatial, social, and infrastructural indicators. The methodology is empirically applied to a sample of schools in the Leningrad Region. The sources include open source spatial data and results of the participatory analysis conducted with schoolchildren.
